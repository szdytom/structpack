# Contributing

To get started, fork this repository and clone it to your local machine. Then, create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/structpack.git
cd structpack
git checkout -b my-feature
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can now start working on your feature. Remember to add tests for your changes to ensure that they work as expected. Also examples and documentation are very welcome.

Run the tests before commiting your changes:

```bash
npm test
```

## Code Style

In most cases, your IDE can automatically format your code so it won't be too much work. Please follow the following points:

- Use TAB for indentation. The tab width is 4 spaces.
- Always use semicolons.
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Always wrap blocks in curly braces.

## Commit Messages

Just be clear and concise, no special formats are required.
